      <title>Regular Review Tasks vs. Project-based Review Tasks</title>
      <p>Content Fusion includes a <i>Projects</i> feature that makes it possible for an
        organization to integrate a Git repository that contains DITA content and changes proposed
        by reviewers can be integrated back into the DITA project directly within Content
        Fusion.</p>
      <p>Review tasks can be created inside or outside projects in Content Fusion and there are some
        difference between the two:</p>

                <li>At the end of the review process, the task owner (<b>Content Author</b>)
                  integrates changes proposed by reviewers into their documentation project using
                    <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b> or another tool outside of Content Fusion.</li>
                <li>There is no interaction between Content Fusion and a remote repository.</li>
                <li>Only the <b>Content Author</b> and the reviewers that are granted access to the
                  task are able to see and access the particular task. </li>

                <li>At the end of the review process, the task owner (<b>Content Author</b>) has the
                  ability to integrate changes proposed by reviewers into their documentation
                  project directly within the Content Fusion browser interface.</li>
                <li>The changes made to a project-based review task are stored in the Git repository
                  and merged into the project's default branch and pushed to the upstream remote
                  repository when the task is finished.</li>
                <li>All the <b>Authors</b> that have access to a project are able to see all review
                  tasks that were created inside that particular project.</li>

      <title>Review Task Ownership</title>
      <p>On any given review task, collaborators have one of the following roles in regard to task
          ownership:<ul id="ul_d5w_sls_1yb">
          <li><b>Reviewer</b> - A collaborator who is not the task owner can review and edit
            content, add messages to communicate with the task owner and other collaborators, and
            mark the task as finalized once they consider the review process is finished.</li>
          <li><b>Owner</b> - The task owner (the person who created the task or another person who
            is assigned as a task owner by the task creator) can review and edit content, add
            messages to communicate with other collaborators, change task settings, decide when to
            close the review task, and for project-based review tasks, they can integrate proposed
            changes and build output deliverables.</li>
        </ul></p>

      <title>User Roles for Project-based Review Tasks</title>
      <p>For organizations that take advantage of the Content Fusion <i>Projects</i> feature, there
        are two user roles that can be assigned by the administrator (from the <uicontrol>Users
          Management</uicontrol> tab found in the Administration Page):<ul id="ul_e3j_yns_1yb">
          <li><b>SME (Subject Matter Expert)</b> - By default, Content Fusion users have the SME
            (Subject Matter Expert) role assigned. They can access review tasks that are assigned to
            them and create tasks from scratch.</li>
          <li><b>Author</b> - This role must be assigned by an administrator. In addition to the
            features that an SME has access to, Authors can access all projects created within the
            organization, create review tasks from inside projects. build output deliverables, and
            other advanced features.</li>

      <title>Review Task States</title>
      <p>Content Fusion review tasks can be in one of the following possible states:<ul
          id="ul_dxr_lps_1yb">
          <li>
            <p><uicontrol>In review</uicontrol> - This is the initial status for newly created
              review tasks and they remain in this state until the task has been closed by the task
              owner. Both reviewers and task owners can edit the task files while in this state.</p>
          </li>
          <li><uicontrol>Review closed</uicontrol> - Tasks are changed to this status when a task
            owner uses the <uicontrol>Close Review</uicontrol> button to close the task. Only task
            owners can edit the task files while in this state (they are read-only for reviewers).
            Task owners can reopen the task and its status will return to <uicontrol>In
              review</uicontrol>.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>Integrating</uicontrol> (for project-based review tasks only) - Tasks are
            changed to this status when a task owner uses the <uicontrol>Start
              Integrating</uicontrol> button to integrate the proposed changes into the project.
            Only the task owner can edit the task files while in this state (they are read-only for
            all other collaborators). Note that this task status is only viewable by those with a
            user role of <b>Author</b>.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>Integrated</uicontrol> (for project-based review tasks only) - Tasks are
            changed to this status when a task owner uses the <uicontrol>Finish
              Integrating</uicontrol> button once the integration is complete. Only task owners can
            edit the task files while in this state (they are read-only for reviewers). Task files
            are read-only for all participants. An integrated review task can no longer be
            re-opened. Note that this task status is only viewable by those with a user role of
              <b>Author</b>.</li>
        </ul></p>
