    <p id="p_fzt_dgk_54b">It is highly recommended that <uicontrol>Reviewers</uicontrol> use some
      sort of mechanism to indicate that the task review process is finished in your workflow and
      all files attached to the task should be reviewed before finalizing the task. Otherwise, the
        <uicontrol>Content Author</uicontrol> may end up merging changes more than once and this
      could result in some complicated conflicts.</p>
    <p id="p_gzt_dgk_54b">You might have your own preferred method of letting the <b>Content
        Author</b> know that you are finished, but <ph keyref="product"/> includes the following
      action that is designed specifically for this purpose:</p>

            (located in the top header stripe) to add a predefined message to the task that lets the
              <b>Content Author</b> know you have reviewed all the files attached and you are
            finished with the process. You can also add an additional optional message to provide
            more details.<note type="other" othertype="Notes" id="note_kzt_dgk_54b">
