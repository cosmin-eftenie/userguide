    <p id="p_h3t_dgk_54b">The <b>Content Author</b> refers to a user who creates documentation in <term>Oxygen XML
        Editor/Author</term>. They have access to the <uicontrol>Content Fusion Tasks
        Manager</uicontrol> view where they can create a task to upload files to be reviewed by
      others. The <b>Content Author</b> then simply shares a link to the task with one or more
        <b>Reviewers</b>.</p>
    <p id="p_i3t_dgk_54b">During the review process, the <b>Content Author</b> (the person who
      creates the task) and all of the <b>Reviewers</b> can communicate directly in the <ph
        keyref="product"/> interface. Once the process is finished, the <b>Content Author</b> has a
      convenient built-in <i>Merge</i> tool to integrate all the changes back into <term>Oxygen XML
        Editor/Author</term>.</p>
    <p id="p_j3t_dgk_54b">This guide provides instructions and information about the features and options the
        <b>Content Author</b> has access to.</p>
