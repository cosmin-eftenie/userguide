    <p id="p_zwt_dgk_54b">The <b>Reviewer</b> refers to subject matter experts (<b>SME</b>) or other
      team members who are asked to review documentation that has been uploaded to the <ph
        keyref="product"/> server by the <b>Content Author</b>. The <b>Reviewer</b> simply uses a
      link that is sent to them to access the task that contains the documents to be reviewed in
      their default browser. They can open each file to proofread, add comments, and make changes in
      a simple visual editor. They can communicate with the <b>Content Author</b> directly in the
      interface and once the <b>Reviewer</b> finishes the review process, the <b>Content Author</b>
      will have the ability to merge all of the changes.</p>
    <p id="p_axt_dgk_54b"><b>Reviewers</b> also have the ability to create a new task in the <ph keyref="product"/>
      browser interface and create new files to attach to the created task.</p>
    <p id="p_bxt_dgk_54b">This guide provides instructions and information about the features and
      options <b>Reviewers</b> have access to.</p>
