    <p>The <uicontrol>Task Activity Page</uicontrol> lists the history of the activity that has
      occurred for the task (e.g. changes and comments).</p>

    <p>All messages and file change notifications are displayed in this page. You can see the name
      of the user who added the message or changed the file and when it was processed. The activity
      stream is automatically refreshed every minute. You can compare changes made by the
        <b>Reviewer</b> by using a <i>diff</i> link that is available for every file change. The
        <i>diff</i> link can be shared between the <b>Content Author</b> and <b>Reviewer</b>.</p>
    <p>You can use the <uicontrol>Add message</uicontrol> button to add messages, making it possible
      to communicate with collaborators directly in the interface. Keep in mind that all messages in
      this panel are attached to the task and not to individual files (to annotate individual files,
      use the <xref
        href="making_changes_to_uploaded_files.dita#making_changes_to_uploaded_files/add-comment"
          ><uicontrol>Add Comment</uicontrol> button in the editor</xref>).</p>
