    <p>The <uicontrol>Task Activity Page</uicontrol> lists the history of the activity that has
      occurred for the task (e.g. changes and comments).</p>

    <p>This page displays all messages and file change notifications. It shows the name of the user
      who added the message or changed the file and when it was processed. The activity stream is
      automatically refreshed every minute. You can compare changes made by the <b>Reviewer</b> by
      using a <i>diff</i> link that is available for every file change. The <i>diff</i> link can be
      shared between the <b>Content Author</b> and <b>Reviewer</b>.</p>
    <p>To communicate with other collaborators directly in the interface, you can use the
        <uicontrol>Add message</uicontrol> button. However, note that all messages in this panel are
      attached to the task and not to individual files (to annotate individual files, use the <xref
        href="making_changes_to_uploaded_files.dita#making_changes_to_uploaded_files/add-comment"
          ><uicontrol>Add Comment</uicontrol> button in the editor</xref>).</p>
