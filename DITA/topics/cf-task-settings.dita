        <dd>This option is selected by default, which means that <i>Change Tracking</i> is always on
          when the <b>Reviewers</b> make changes or add comments in the files attached to the task.
          This allows you and other <b>Reviewers</b> to see exactly what has been changed and you
          will have the ability to accept or reject the changes after you have integrated them back
          into <term>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</term>. If you deselect this option, the <i>Change
            Tracking</i> mechanism is turned off for this particular task, but other tasks are not
          affected.</dd>
