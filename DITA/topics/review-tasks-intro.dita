    <p><uicontrol>Review Tasks</uicontrol> is one of the two main components (along with
        <b>Projects</b>) within the Content Fusion browser interface. There are two main types of
      review task users, <i>Reviewers</i> and <i>Task Owners</i>:<ul id="ul_bjx_3vw_sdc">
        <li id="li_pmh_jvw_sdc"><b>Task Owners</b> - Can create and manage review tasks from the
          browser interface or in <i>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</i>. They have access to task
          settings, share options, and they can ultimately merge proposed changes into their
          project.</li>
        <li id="li_cjx_3vw_sdc"><b>Reviewers</b> - Can use a link that is shared with them by a task
          owner to open documents from a review task in an online visual editor where they can
          proofread, add comments, and make changes.</li>
      </ul></p>
