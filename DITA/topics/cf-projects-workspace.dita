    <p>The <term>personal workspace</term> feature allows you to make changes across multiple files
      within a project and then commit them to the project.</p>
    <p id="p_lg2_4yb_tbc">Once a project is open, an additional stripe is displayed below the top
      stripe with an <uicontrol>Edit in workspace</uicontrol> button that creates a personal
      workspace branch starting from the latest version on the project branch. If a personal
      workspace is already created, invoking the button opens the already existing workspace. You
      can also go straight to the personal workspace from the <xref
        href="cf-projects.dita#cf-projects/projects_main_page">main Projects page</xref>.</p>

    <p id="p_w3v_jzb_tbc">Once inside a personal workspace, the second top stripe changes to make it
      clear that you are editing inside the <uicontrol>Personal Workspace</uicontrol>. The left
      stripe contains navigation options to open the <xref

        add a folder to the workspace, click the 3 vertical dots next to the parent folder and
        select <uicontrol>New Folder</uicontrol>. You can create a folder on the root level by
        selecting <uicontrol>New Folder</uicontrol> from the 3 vertical dots menu in the
          <i>Files</i> header at the top. To delete a folder from the workspace, click the 3

        folder</uicontrol>.</p>
      <p>Click on a file to open it in the visual editor. To create a new file within a folder,
        click the 3 vertical dots next to the folder where you want the new file stored and select
          <uicontrol>New File</uicontrol>. This opens a dialog box where you can select from a set
        of templates and enter a title for the new file. To create a file in the root directory,
        select <uicontrol>New File</uicontrol> from the 3 vertical dots menu in the <i>Files</i>

      <p>The left pane shows the incoming changes. You can toggle the <uicontrol>Show only
          conflicts</uicontrol> button to filter the list to focus on the conflicts. There are three
        types of incoming changes and each have a dedicated icon:<ul>
          <li><image href="../img/cfConflicts18.png"/> - Conflicting changes that cannot be
            automatically merged and require manual intervention.</li>
          <li><image href="../img/cfMergeableConflicts18.png"/> - Incoming changes can be
            automatically merged.</li>
          <li><image href="../img/cfMergeable18.png"/> - Incoming files from the project that are
            not present in your workspace.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>The incoming changes that can be automatically merged (<image
          href="../img/cfMergeableConflicts18.png"/>) and new files coming from the project (<image
          href="../img/cfMergeable18.png"/>) do not require any manual action and will be merged
        when you click the <uicontrol>Pull</uicontrol> button. Conflicting files (<image
          href="../img/cfConflicts18.png"/>) require that you choose an action from the drop-down to
        the right of the file entry. The possible actions are:<ul>
          <li><uicontrol>Manual merge</uicontrol> - The user must edit the file and merge the
            changes manually.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>Keep workspace changes</uicontrol> - Overrides the changes coming from the
            project with your workspace changes.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>Keep project changes</uicontrol> - Keeps the changes coming from the
            project and discards your workspace changes.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>Click the file entry to display a comparison of the two versions of the document. The
        current workspace version of the document is displayed on the left while the version from
        the project is displayed on the right. You can use the toolbar buttons to navigate through
        the changes or copy changes from the right to left (from the project to the workspace).</p>
      <p>You can also edit your current workspace version in the left side and it includes content
        completion and contextual menu actions. Note that if you change the <uicontrol>Manual
          merge</uicontrol> option to another type of resolution, your changes are discarded.</p>
      <p>Once you are finished, click the <uicontrol>Pull</uicontrol> button in the bottom-right
        corner to finish the conflict resolution and merge the changes. If you close the dialog box
        without using the <uicontrol>Pull</uicontrol> button, your changes are discarded.</p>
